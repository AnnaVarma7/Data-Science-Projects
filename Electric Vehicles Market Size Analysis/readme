⚡ Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis
This project presents a data-driven analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market in the United States. It explores EV adoption trends, regional distribution, manufacturer dominance, electric range progression, and forecasts the market size over the next five years.

🎯 Objective
To analyze the historical and current landscape of EV registrations and estimate future growth using statistical modeling, enabling strategic insights for manufacturers, policymakers, and investors.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
Scipy – Exponential forecasting

📊 Analysis Breakdown
1. EV Adoption Over Time
Steady growth since 2010, with a significant spike post-2016.
2023 saw the highest EV registrations to date.
Data confirms increasing consumer confidence and policy-driven adoption.

2. Geographic Distribution
EV adoption is concentrated in specific counties.
King County (Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond) leads in registrations.
Regional imbalance suggests opportunities for EV infrastructure expansion.

3. Electric Vehicle Types
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate over Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Indicates a growing preference for fully electric over hybrid alternatives.

4. Popular Makes & Models
TESLA is the market leader, especially with MODEL Y and MODEL 3.
NISSAN (LEAF) and CHEVROLET (BOLT, VOLT) are key players.
Model-level analysis reveals strong consumer preference for long-range, reliable EVs.

5. Electric Range Insights
The average electric range is ~59 miles, skewed lower by early hybrid models.
TESLA vehicles offer the highest ranges, led by the ROADSTER and MODEL S.
Range has consistently improved from 2010 to 2020, addressing range anxiety concerns.
