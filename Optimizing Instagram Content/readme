Analyzes seasonal trends
Recommends the best actions for follower growth and virality

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
Data source: Instagram performance CSV export

📁 Dataset
The dataset includes:
Post metadata: description, publish time, post type
Engagement metrics: impressions, reach, likes, shares, comments, saves, follows
Time-based and topic-tagged transformations for detailed analysis

📈 Key Analyses & Insights
📌 1. Post Type Performance
IG Reels generate the most active engagement (likes, comments, saves)
Carousels yield higher reach and impressions
Images perform well with promotions but inconsistently organically

Action-oriented content also performs strongly across metrics

📈 4. New Followers by Post Type
Reels generate the highest number of new followers (47.4%)
Carousels have the lowest follower conversion

🚀 5. What Goes Viral
Viral posts peak around Projects and Career Growth
