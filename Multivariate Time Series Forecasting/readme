📈 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Python
This project demonstrates how to perform multivariate time series forecasting on stock market data using Vector AutoRegression (VAR). The goal is to capture interdependencies between multiple variables (stock prices) and forecast their future values.

🎯 Objective
To forecast the future closing prices of multiple stocks (AAPL, MSFT, NFLX, GOOG) by leveraging their historical relationships and interactions over time.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python
pandas, matplotlib – Data wrangling and visualization
statsmodels – VAR modeling and stationarity testing
ADF Test – To check for time series stationarity

📁 Dataset
Source: stocks.csv
Stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Netflix (NFLX), Google (GOOG)
Time Range: Feb 7, 2023 – May 5, 2023
Features: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume

🔄 Key Steps
1. Data Preparation
Converted Date to datetime format
Verified absence of missing values
Differenced the Close prices to make them stationary

2. Stationarity Check
Applied Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to confirm non-stationarity
Differenced the series and re-tested; all series became stationary (p-value < 0.05)

3. Model Training & Forecasting
Pivoted data by date and ticker
Trained VAR model using optimal lag (based on AIC)
Forecasted next 5 days of differenced values
Reversed differencing to restore forecasted values to original scale

4. Forecast Output
Example:

Date	AAPL	GOOG	MSFT	NFLX
2023-05-06	174.37	113.62	320.18	327.60
2023-05-07	169.68	104.91	318.41	342.70
...	...	...	...	...

5. Visualization
Plotted historical vs. forecasted closing prices for each stock
Used dashed lines for forecasted data to distinguish trends

🧠 Insights
VAR effectively models interdependencies across multiple stock prices.
Differencing was essential to meet stationarity requirements.
The model captured short-term patterns despite limited historical data.

📝 Summary
Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using Python enables predictive modeling for multiple related time series. This project showed how stock closing prices can be forecasted simultaneously using a VAR model, with proper data preparation, stationarity enforcement, and interpretation of results.
