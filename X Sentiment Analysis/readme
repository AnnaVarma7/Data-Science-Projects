ðŸ§  Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Python
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using natural language processing. By analyzing the tone of tweets, it helps identify the general moodâ€”positive, negative, or neutralâ€”of a public discussion.

ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview
The dataset contains real tweets (focused on Elon Musk), with the following key fields:
text: The tweet content
user_name, user_followers, etc. (used for context but not in sentiment analysis)
retweets, favorites, is_retweet: Engagement metrics

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy
NLTK â€“ for text preprocessing and sentiment scoring
Scikit-learn â€“ for potential future model building

ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing
âœ… Cleaning Steps
Removed URLs, punctuation, numbers, and stopwords
Applied stemming using NLTK's SnowballStemmer
Converted tweets to lowercase

ðŸ“Š Sentiment Analysis
Used NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer (VADER) to generate sentiment scores:
Positive: Probability of positive sentiment
Negative: Probability of negative sentiment
Neutral: Probability of neutral tone
Tweets were classified by comparing these scores.

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Total sentiment distribution:
Positive: ~969
Negative: ~325
Neutral: ~4584

âž• Insight:
Although most tweets were neutral, negative tweets outnumbered positive ones, indicating a slightly negative undertone in the discussion.

ðŸ’¡ Summary
This project demonstrates:
Text cleaning & NLP preprocessing
Applying sentiment analysis using VADER
Aggregating scores to interpret the public mood
Use-case relevance for social media monitoring and hate speech detection
