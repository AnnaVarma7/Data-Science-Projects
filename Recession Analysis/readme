📉 Recession Analysis (UK GDP)
This project analyzes recession periods in the UK economy based on monthly and quarterly GDP growth data. It detects recession periods and evaluates their severity using historical trends.

🎯 Objective
Identify periods of recession using GDP contraction over consecutive quarters
Visualize GDP trends and recession severity over time
Understand economic contraction patterns to aid in macroeconomic insights

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas – Data preprocessing & resampling
Plotly – Interactive data visualizations

📁 Dataset Overview
Source: UK Monthly GDP Growth Rates
Columns:
Time Period: Month and year

GDP Growth: Monthly GDP growth rate (%)

🧪 Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
Parsed date strings and converted the dataset to a time-indexed DataFrame
Resampled monthly GDP data to quarterly averages

2. Recession Detection
Recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth
Binary flag created to label each quarter as recession or not

3. Visual Analysis
Heatmap of monthly GDP growth
Line graph showing GDP growth over time with recession periods marked in red

Bar chart visualizing:
Duration of each recession period
Severity (sum of negative GDP growth during recession)

📊 Key Insights
Q1 and Q2 of 2020 mark a significant recession with sharp GDP contraction due to COVID-19
Recession detection logic works effectively with time-series resampling
Severity analysis quantifies both duration and depth of each economic downturn

💡 Future Enhancements
Include other indicators: Unemployment Rate, Consumer Spending, CPI
Build a recession prediction model using machine learning
Add interactive filters for time range and severity levels in dashboards
