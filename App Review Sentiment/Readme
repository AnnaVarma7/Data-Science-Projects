## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Classify reviews into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment categories based on text.
- **Dataset**: A CSV file containing LinkedIn app reviews and associated user ratings.
- **Techniques Used**: Text pre-processing, sentiment analysis using TextBlob, data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib, and WordCloud generation.

## 🗂️ Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**  
   Loaded a dataset containing 702 LinkedIn app reviews with user ratings.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized the distribution of ratings  
   - Analyzed review lengths  
   - Generated count plots and histograms  

3. **Sentiment Labeling**  
   Used **TextBlob** to assign a sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) to each review based on polarity.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Visualized sentiment distribution overall and across ratings  
   - Explored correlations between review sentiment and star ratings  

5. **Text Analysis**  
   Created **Word Clouds** for each sentiment class to uncover commonly used words.

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Many 1-star reviews use neutral language, indicating possible UX or functional issues rather than dissatisfaction.
- Word clouds show positive reviews focus on "useful", "great", and "helpful", while negative ones mention "crash", "slow", and "contact".

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Apply VADER or a transformer-based model for more nuanced sentiment classification  
- Perform topic modeling (LDA) to group reviews by themes  
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for interactive analysis

---

## ✨ Fun Fact

Even with low ratings, the app’s users often express themselves in relatively neutral terms—a reminder that numbers alone don’t tell the full story!
